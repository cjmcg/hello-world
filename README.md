Hello World!!
Using this for the tutorial to learn more about git repository creation and pull requests.<p>
I am writing some extra lines for the tutorial, so as to change this code and save a commit.<p>
This is an easy example of changing code within a new branch, and then saving it as a commit for being pushed to the Master later on.<p>
  Adding some HTML code to see if I can manipulate <b>formatting</b>, which apparently I can.
  Also want to add a link to a tutorial webpage for GitHub in general, with speicific areas of study. You can click on <a href="https://guides.github.com/">THIS LINK</a> to go to the page. <p>
I have discovered an interesting aspect of commits. If I save this page as I am typing, rather than checking the output with the "Preview Changes" tab, it creates a separate commit each time. That is why there are eight different commits for this Master already submitted.<p>
Now, I would like to create a pull requet on this branch and see the collaboration capabilities of GitHub for development.
